I miss you uncontrollably, I still have your picture in my wallet.
I lay awake staring at stilted well-lit streets and air conditioned hallways.
I think of June Carter, I dress in black, I am the hero.

Him in your golden hands.
Not jealous.  No access.
Ultimately, I feel betrayed.

Studying only what does distress you.
Exercise what does impress you.
Ultimately pointless.

Absinthe and complimentary beers,
built around musings of you.
Accoutrements.

Him in your golden hands.
Not jealous.  No access.
Him in your golden hands.
Not waiting.  Just at rest.
Him in your golden hands.
Not jealous.  No access.

Ultimately, I feel betrayed.

Waking up at midnight with your girlfriend on your mind.
But you're going back in time.
For these moments are not mine.
You and me have been resigned, 
we have gone our separate ways
and you've shown me how that works.

Broke up in high school and that seems so long ago.
When everything was childs play.
But I couldn't keep her hanging on.
I miss being so close to you, I miss hanging out with you, is that so crazy?
We were only just kids.
She doesn't know me.  I'm so different back then.  I'm just illogical.
I should go back to sleep.
