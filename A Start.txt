I open my heart.
To the lark.
The day must start.
I cling to a star.

She opens her eyes
and the answer lies
In her candle light
After a fight

I whisper in her ear
Maybe she didn't hear
Maybe she fears
I'll disappear

And it's only the start.
Of the season.

She opens her heart
To the dark.
A guiding light
To the hiding, hemisphere.

And it's only the start.
And it's only the start.

Her heart, is an ocean, deeper, darker, I wonder.
What is swimming in your sea?

A rising sun.
In the coldest season.
A star rising.
But it clings to the horizon.

A rising light.
In the cold blue night.
A rising star, well that's a start.
